Another Way, [Chorus]
             I smoke another to the face (Ayy, ayy)
             Whenever I don't feel okay (Ayy, ayy)
             There's gotta be another way (Ayy, ayy)
             For me to get rid of my shame (Ayy)
             Take narcotics to the face (Ayy, ayy)
             Fuckin' up my brain (Ayy, ayy)
             My emotions in a cage (Ayy, ayy)
             They can't be contained (Ayy, ayy)
             They can't be contained (Ayy, ayy)
             She want me out her way (Ayy, ayy)
             Tryna throw away the key (Ayy, ayy)
             Love is not a game, I am not ashamed (Ayy, ayy)

             [Verse]
             Bitch, I'm fucked up, tryna clean the mess up
             Yeah, I fucked up, yeah, I had to 'fess up
             I'm a robot for her love, Alexa
             When they say her name wrong, it's Alexia
             This is not an ordinary woman
             I feel like I love her to the fullest
             Cupid ain't been shooting at me with no ordinary bullets
             That's my biggest problem, I feel over-hooked
             Shit, I was always scared of gettin' overlooked
             Consequences in my side, I wish I never looked
             Breaking up, never us
             Fuck the time, it's forever us (Ayy, ayy)

             [Chorus]
             Whenever I don't feel okay (Ayy, ayy)
             There's gotta be another way (Ayy)
             For me to get rid of my shame (Ayy)
             Take narcotics to the face (Ayy, ayy)
             Fuckin' up my brain (Ayy, ayy)
             My emotions in a cage (Ayy, ayy)
             They can't be contained (Ayy, ayy)
             They can't be contained (Ayy, ayy)
             She want me out her way (Ayy, ayy)
             Tryna throw away the key (Ayy, ayy)
             Love is not a game, I am not ashamed (Ayy, ayy)
